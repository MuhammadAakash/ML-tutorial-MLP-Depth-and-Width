This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook tutorial that demonstrates the effects of neural network architecture on decision boundaries using scikit-learn. The tutorial includes interactive widgets that allow you to dynamically adjust network parameters and observe the results in real time.

## Installation

Install the required Python packages using `pip`:

```bash
pip install scikit-learn numpy matplotlib ipywidgets
```
# Execution

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook.

2. Run the cells sequentially.

3. Use the interactive widgets to adjust the network's:

    - Depth (number of hidden layers)

    - Width (number of neurons per layer)

    - Training iterations

The interactive section will immediately update the decision boundary plot to reflect your changes.
